Introduction
Last project
Functionality of the last project
Functionality you developed


In java, assume you are getting a new client, and they need to register themselves in your portal... can you tell me who the rest api flow work in this scenario?
-- service layer ... business layer
what will be the input/parameter to the controller? .. 
---- custom model class.. (right)

Assume you created the above... suppose you have an admin user, who has to provode a list of providers... how will you write this in RestAPI?


Assume if I want a filter criteria... how will you implement that?

Assume there are many parameter... say to search based on filter on many fields... how will you implement that?
==> criteria interfac with meetscriteria method...
==> multiple concrete classes meeting diff criteria and method's diff implementations
==>.new class ..pass list to method of perticular implementation of criteria method

333--------------------------------------------


When you try to generate a report, if you have a huge list of doctors (thousands) active, how will you design this ? on the front end and back end?
--pagination?
==> loading all doctors dta would take lot of time and may crash also..so divide and load few doctors data in one multile pages is called pagination...
with use of Paging AndSorting repository provided by springboot..
==> saveAll method with parameter size,number,sorting order
==> springbatch---reader ,writer, processor , 

what are the parameters you would use in pagination ?
==> Static Pagination With Spring Data This is the most convenient way to implement pagination in a web application. 
It only needs to get the page and the number of result per page for a query.
 Instead of using Repository or CrudRepository, you should use PaginationAndSortingRepository, which accepts an object of the "Pageable" type.

Do you know how to connect to MySQL using Hibernate ?
==> hibernate config

How good are you with Lambda functions ?

Can you tell me a simple stream that you have used in your last project ?
==> filter function list.stream.sorterd(comparator)

Can you please tell me about Spring beans and its scope ?
==>Spring Bean Scope Bean Scope refers to the lifecycle of a bean, visibility of a bean, how long does the bean live, 
how many instances are created, how is the bean shared

In a multi threaded environment, will it be good to use Singleton?
==> yes ,for good memory  memory management ,if multiple instances then multiple threads will have to choose among which instance to access 


444-----------------------------------------

2. What are backend changes required, if the request submit with N multiple phone numbers (N value is dynamic). Initially request contains only one phone number? 
==>    Changes in bean class using @jointable(to map foreign key of second table in first table..so ) and @onetomany insert phones in anther table 


3.	How will you implement insert the details from excel to database ?
==>	We can implement logic using POI library create sheet reference object to establish with sheet and implement nested for loop to fetch each and each cell value 
      and assign to bean class or map collection and save the details to table using Repo class 
==>   I think for excel to DB, they were looking for “save all” or “bulk insert” right?...

4.	Continuation to above question, how will insert multiple details to database? or how to insert bulk data to database? 
==>  We can consider List and use saveall method to insert bulk data 
==>   spring batch

5.	What are different types of scopes for Spring Bean ? 
==>	There are singleton, prototype, request, session, global session 

6.	What is Autowired? 
==>	Inserting objects/beans from spring ioc containers(appln context or bean factory) at runtime by Spring dependency injection mechanism 



555---------------------------------------------------


3.	was also asked about the file IO scenario and query to find the 2nd highest salary

4.	Explain flow of creating a rest API for getting user data =>get api
==>

5.  How to calculate user salary from an excel file and persist(extend serializable--input binary stream ) it to DB 
==>    

6.	What will u do if the salary calculation part is taking too much time (i.e. use threads)
==>  threaads use

7.	What is a thread pool and why we use it
==> 

8.	Producer consumer problem in thread(i.e. inter thread communication)

9.	What is context switching

10.	Why we need spring framework

14.	How good are you with Oracle…? 

18.	Diff between array and vector

22. Secondary caches in hibernate 
==> ehcache cache configs file  

24.	A user wants to upload file into system. This file is very huge (say Million records). 
the file contains delimited fields. Each line is a record. Objective for u is to upload this into DB table. 
Do some conversion. How will you do this. This upload will take hours to upload say 5 hours. 
The user will upload. What will happen to the user end? Session will expire in 30min at user end. User will not have 
info on what’s happening What would you propose on how to keep the user informed? Keep performance in mind.. when you provide solution to above.
==>
parallel stream

6666---------------------

5. What approach would you provide for retrieving the deatils of a customer with some filter criteria.
==> criteria api use restriction class

6. If we want to retrieve a customer information, what all could be the possible ways for perfoming the operation - 
Http methods and also the input that can be used. 
==> get load
==> criteria api
==> query

777-------------------------

Scenario-2 : I have a screen which should show all the customers. Can you write a method for that?
-- I need a filter criteria. How will you implement that?
-- in your input / RestAPI function, what will be your input? I want the filter string to be passed. How will you pass it to the controller class -->> Query param? Path param? Post method?
-- What will be the return type? (list of objects)

888--------------------------


how the documents are stored in your system ?
How the upload works? Details of how many candidates are included in one excel?
how do you read this in program?
Does the upload completion happen immediately? Or does the user have to wait?
is there any batch involved?
>>>Assume if the excel grows very large? Do you have any solution to improve the performance?-- Cache? what kind of cache-ing can you implement?
if you want to insert 1000's of records very fast, how will you do that?
==> batch processing---batchsize ---persist , flush , clear and then commit

What is your return type? What does your response body contain?
==>return type list of obj , consumer=application/json

You have to click on the link of a candidate name... then you need to show all the details of the candidate... 
I am asking you to write a RestAPI call to return all the info... can you give me the construct of this
==>

999--------------------------


4.How to handle performance while uploading bulk data.
==>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=30
==>using saveall method of jpa pass list to 1000's of users to it


Scenario based questions:-
- Having table with customer data and want to add multiple phone number to a single customer, how needs to modify the system on the basis of java front.

- How to read an excel file having huge data on daily basis with java
==>using POI library and pagination


3. Application flow from frontend to Database (Angular -> SpringBoot -> DB)
4. How to extract parameter present in URL for applying filtration of data ?
==> request , path 
==> hibernate validation--regular expresssion
==> 

5. How to pass multiple parameters in URL ?
==>public void invoice(@RequestParam(name="invoiceNo") List<String> invoiceNos, @RequestParam(name="invoiceDate") List<String> invoiceDates)


101010-----------------------

If you press ‘submit’ button more than once accidentally, how would you 
have your application manage that without allowing multiple updates happening in the backend”.
==> front end solution--<input id="btnSubmit" type="submit" onclick="this.disabled = true">
==> backend solution---constarint voilet----unique constarint error---handle ---
